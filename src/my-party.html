        <p>The Democratic Action Party, or DAP (Malay: Parti Tindakan Demokratik, Chinese: 民主行动党, Tamil: ஜனநாயக செயல் கட்சி) is a multi-racial, centre-left Malaysian political party advocating social democracy and secularism.</p>
        <p>Following the 2013 Malaysian general election, the Democratic Action Party (DAP) became Malaysia's largest opposition party, over the two other main opposition parties PKR and PAS, as well as the second largest political party after the ruling UMNO.</p>
        <p>The party's vision is to establish a peaceful and prosperous social democracy that can unite its disparate races and diverse religions and cultures based on a Malaysian Malaysia concept of forging a Malaysian race grounded on universal moral values, offering equal access and opportunity, upholding democratic governance and the rule of law, creating wealth and distributing it equitably, and fighting corruption.</p>
        <p>The DAP usually draw much of their support from secular and liberal religious voters with a stable electorate from voters of big cities, coastal regions, professional middle-class, and working class. The party's strongholds include the state of Penang, Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Johor and the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur. In the 2013 Malaysian general election, DAP contested in 51 federal constituencies and won 38 seats, representing a win rate of 75%, the highest among the major political parties contesting.</p>
